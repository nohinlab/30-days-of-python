### My Progress :
* 14/56 Videos from 

### Notes :
* Iteration patterns :
    - Counting in a loop : introducing a counter variable and incrementing it in the loop
    - Summing in a loop : introducing a sum variable and adding the value to it in the loop
    - Combining counting and summing pattern to find the average
    - Filtering in a loop : introducing if statement in the loop to catch the desired value
    - Searching with a boolean variable : introducing a boolean variable initialized to False and setting it to True if the desired value is found (add break statement to stop the loop)
    - Finding the largest or smallest value : introducing a variable initialized to None and comparing it with the desired value in the loop
* None is constant nonetype type
* 'is' is stronger than '==' because it checks the type of the variable as well and no conversion is done
